 Information about what Largemouth Bass do in weather change and what they eat 
 </h1>

<p1 style="font-size:100%;"><p>Adult largemouth bass feed on ﬁsh, crayﬁsh and frogs. Young Largemouth Bass will feed on crustaceans, insects, and small ﬁsh. Some largemouth can be cannibalistic just like northern pike.

What they do in hotter weather: During the peak of summer when the heat becomes the strongest, the bass move to cooler shady water close to the bottom. In clear conditions Largemouth Bass feed predominantly by sight.

What they do in the winter: Often times the bass in Winter will pull off shore and lay in the lowest, deepest spot they can find off shore. If you're on a small body of water this probably means the middle of the deepest coves. If you're on a big body of water this could be the middle of a bay or even the center of the lake, miles offshore.

What bass do in spring: bass will seek out different types of structure at different times of the year. In the spring, fish will gravitate towards ideal spawning areas, and in the fall, they will shift their attention towards finding an abundance of food to fatten up for the winter.
